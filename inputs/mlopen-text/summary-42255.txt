In Unforgettable, Dr. David Krane is unsuccessfully framed for the murder of his wife. He then attempts to find the true killer, with the help of Dr. Martha Briggs , by using an experimental drug that allows him to experience another person's memories. The drug takes a heavy toll and it's a race to find out the truth before time runs out. In the end it is revealed that Bresler, a policeman, was the one that killed Krane's wife, in order to frame Eddie Dutton, who was the prime suspect in the murder. Bresler goes to jail for a long time, while Krane ends up in a comatose state due to an overdose of the drug. Briggs and Gleick, Bresler's partner, realize the comatose Krane is in is a 'better place' where he can be with his late wife.
