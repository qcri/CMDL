Fourteen-year old Marcus is growing up in a rough part of New York City. His father is dead, and his mother languishes in prison for murder. He lives with his grandmother, whose work as a bartender gives Marcus a lot of unsupervised time to hang out with other teens. The teens spend their time doing mischief and petty crimes such as stealing CDs and running shoes. Before long, the teens plan more serious crimes. Marcus' friend Melena , who also grew up in a rough, abusive home, tries to steer Marcus away from the path of crime.
