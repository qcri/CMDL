Barnyard Dawg invites Foghorn to see a total eclipse for free. Foghorn takes the bait, placing his head through a hole in a fence and Dawg smashes a pumpkin over Foghorn's head. To get revenge, Foghorn sets up a prank by dousing water over Dawg, luring him around a tree, and then punching the Dawg with a trick camera. Henery Hawk is walking on the top of a fence with a rope, and when he sees Foghorn he lassos him around the neck. In response, Foghorn chases Henery away. Dejected, Henery encounters the Dawg, who promises to help him catch Foghorn in exchange for a bone. As he looks for one he also is prompted to get a fish for a cat and some cheese for a mouse. Foghorn sees Henery attempting to retrieve the cheese and runs over to stop him. Foghorn warns Henery that there is a "right way and a wrong way" to handling the mouse trap, which then snaps on Foghorn. Henery meanwhile is at a pond trying to catch a fish. Foghorn then turns his attention to Henery, who based on advice from the cat is digging for a bone. Henery takes the bone and places it in a wagon along with the fish and the piece of cheese. In between assisting Henery, Foghorn pulls various pranks on the Dawg. After that Henery gives the items he collected to their respective collector. Seeing this, Foghorn asks Henery why he did not receive a present. The Dawg knocks Foghorn out cold with the bone, and presents him to Henery. Henery rides the same model train that foghorn used earlier, with the unconscious Foghorn behind him.
