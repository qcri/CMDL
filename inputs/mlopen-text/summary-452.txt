A gangster and a corrupt police officer travel to the tiny remote island of Mapado to hunt down a young woman who has run off with a winning lottery ticket. Upon arriving, they discover that no one lives there except for five old women who have not once seen a man for 20 years. Both men soon experience a nightmare of hard labour and harassment.
