One is the Japanese yakuza gang in possession of stolen diamonds, and the other is a group of terrorists with a stockpile of ammunition. Whilst visiting the police station he meets Quito , an old friend from when they were in the orphanage. As they embrace each other in a friendly hug, some passing police officers get the wrong idea and decide to tell her husband, Albert . Albert refuses to listen to Quito and attempts to fight Kidstuff. Later, when Kidstuff and Quito decide to dine together, Albert secretly hides under their table. Kidstuff goes to ask his old Lucky Stars gang for help . However, they refuse to help as they have embarked on a new crime spree, so Kidstuff is forced to find a new gang. First he recruits Top Dog , so called because of his affinity with dogs. Second is Fat Cat , a lazy cop, who joins because Kidstuff throws money at him. Next is Lambo a lady's man, followed by Long Legs ([[Anthony Chan and Libbogen , a pair of timid cops who flee in the face of danger.
