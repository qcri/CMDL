Ahingsa is a young man who's haunted by his karma, which takes the form of a mysterious red-haired man who dishes out abuse when Ahingsa runs afoul of morality. When Ahingsa was a young boy, a shaman had the mysterious man removed, but the man returns when Ahingsa is a young man and starts taking drugs and getting involved in rave culture. Ahingsa's behavior soon causes trouble for his friends, Ukhoht and Einstein, and a female physician, Dr. Pattaya.
