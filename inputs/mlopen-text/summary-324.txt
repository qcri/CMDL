Alarm clocks ring everywhere throughout SpongeBob's house and even in Squidward's house. SpongeBob's foghorn alarm spits out some more, and SpongeBob wakes up and stops them. SpongeBob remembers that, on this day, the Krusty Krab celebrates its "eleventy seventh" anniversary. He remembers his first visit to the Krusty Krab and tells Gary about it: Years ago, when SpongeBob's mother was still pregnant with him, she and SpongeBob's father went to the Krusty Krab to eat there. His mother asked him what he wanted , and he asked for a Krabby Patty. They were so good, SpongeBob took off his umbilical cord and sucked on it. When he finishes his flashback, SpongeBob showers, goes through the wringer, puts on his clothes and drinks a can of socks . He then puts on his shoes and goes over to the mirror, opens the door on it and looks through a collection of his faces. He takes off the one he already has on, and then replaces it with his "eager face". SpongeBob then leaves to go to the Krusty Krab, but as soon as he exits his house, he bumps into the back of an unbelievably long line of customers waiting to get to the restaurant as well. SpongeBob jumps on top of every second person in the line, then eventually reaches the Krusty Krab front door and squirms underneath it. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward that this is a perfect opportunity for his former best friend Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula . Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard, so that he does not have to pay for a real one. SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab with ketchup, mustard and pink toilet paper. He then turns the Krabby Patties into balloons with an air pump, but then mentions that has one last decoration. Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture which he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. While finding their way through air shafts, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives, including the first Krabby Patty commercial in which Krabs, baby SpongeBob and his parents played , the time Mr. Krabs first conveyed the Krabby Patty formula to SpongeBob while they travelled around the world, the day SpongeBob moved to Bikini Bottom , and also a time when SpongeBob and Sandy got married - which turned out to be a play without the priest knowing. . To get out of the air shaft, SpongeBob gathers Squidward, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs to bust out the shaft, but it takes a few tries, On his last try, he says to himself, OK, this is the one! Feel very good about this! OK, steady..., and he finally makes it out, only to find that all the customers have left after waiting for so long without getting any food. However, SpongeBob summons them all back as he sings a song in honour of the Krusty Krab, called "Oh, Krusty Krab" . Meanwhile, Plankton finally finds the perfect opportunity to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. He fails, having Mr. Krabs to launch him, but Plankton tells Krabs that he cannot take any more launches, having been launched countless times by Krabs in the past. So, Krabs instead inflates Plankton into a balloon and floats him up into the sky. The eleventy seventh anniversary celebration then goes ahead.{{cite web}}<ref name Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants 'Truth or Square' Grabs 7.7 Million Total Viewers, Ranks as Number-One Entertainment Show on Basic Cable for Week | publisher 10 November 2009 | url 1353806 | accessdate Secondary plot During the show, Patchy the Pirate continuously keeps trying to get a cast for a show to celebrate the 10th year anniversary of SpongeBob, he calls Rosario Dawson, but she hangs up on him because of his breath from eating shrimp cocktails.
