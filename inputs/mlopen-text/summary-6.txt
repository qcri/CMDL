The president is on his way to give a speech. While he is traveling there a man shows up with a camera. A reporter tries to ask a member of the secret service a question. When the president enters he is shot by the man with the camera. The president's main bodyguard, Alex Thomas , is grazed by the bullet that hits the president. The shooter is gunned down by Alex and other secret service agents. The president dies at the hospital. Kate Crawford , an investigative journalist, starts asking questions about the assassination. Anyone she questions is killed. She goes to Alex Thomas's house to tell him what is happening. As they head to his boat, Thomas sees some men hiding in the bushes. He throws Kate into the water and dives in. Thomas jumps out of the water to kill two of the hitmen while a third hitman drives off to inform his boss what happened. They are able to link the hitmen to a man called Jack Baldwin . Agent Thomas and other Secret Service members attack the location of Jack Baldwin. Baldwin escapes but is later caught by Thomas. Thomas and Crawford are suspicious of Vaughan Stevens , Agent Thomas's boss, who had previous links to Baldwin. While reviewing film of the assassination at his house, Thomas discovers that Stevens handed the assassin a gun during the president's entrance. Thomas leaves to find Stevens while Kate stays at his house. When Thomas arrives at Stevens' home he finds him dead. Before entering, Thomas sees a car leaving the house. He then receives a call that Baldwin has escaped. Kate is attacked by Baldwin but Thomas arrives and kills Baldwin. Thomas arrives at the first lady's home to see the car that left Steven's house pulling away. Thomas discovers that the first lady wanted her husband killed - due to the fact that the President was being unfaithful to her. A few weeks later Kate and Thomas have dinner. Thomas says that he still doesn't know who wanted the President dead.
