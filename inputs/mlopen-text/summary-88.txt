A roving band of Japanese karate fighters led by a masked, long-haired warrior enter a remote village in China hoping to get their hands on the local supply of "Dragon Herb." There they come into conflict with a group of Chinese kung fu fighters seeking to defend the herb. Tensions escalate, and the Chinese are defeated in several fights with the clearly superior Japanese force. Luckily, help arrives in the form of an outlaw kung fu expert , who faces off against the Japanese leader in a climactic fight on the beach.
