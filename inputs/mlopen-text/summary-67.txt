Ralph Bellamy is "The Healer" in this 1930s morally uplifting pot-boiler. Bellamy is a doctor that has come home to a warm springs to try to heal children from the unnamed crippling disease . He runs a destitute camp for these children, assisted by Evelyn who looks upon the Doc as a great man. Mickey Rooney is Jimmy, a paraplegic kid whom the Doc promises to cure. This little triangle is interrupted by rich girl Joan who cons the good Doc into building a sanitorium for the wealthy with her father's money. Doc is momentarily swayed, but comes to his senses just as a forest fire threatens his original cabins around the warm spring. His treatment of Jimmy pays off as Jimmy rides a bicycle to save the day. Doc realizes that his true love is Evelyn, not the self-interested Joan.
