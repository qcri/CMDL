Set on the north eastern coast of India this unusual Indian film mixes the genres of Bollywood with a tough hard hitting look at Indian society looking at areas of women's place in Indian village society, cross dressing, rape and the history of Indian folk song. These provocitive issues are woven into a story using folk songs to tell the story and in one memorable scene poking fun at the Bollywood style musical number.
