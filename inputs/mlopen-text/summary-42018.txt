Yang Mija is a 66-year old grandmother living on government welfare and a small job taking care of an elderly man. She takes care of her grandson, whose divorced mother lives in Busan. He is spiteful and runs the home. Despite the fact that the registration period is over, she enters a poetry class at the local community center. At the suggestion of her teacher she begins writing notes on the things she sees. Her grandson only interacts with his five male friends from school. After a poetry class, Mija meets the fathers of the group of friends only to discover that the group has, over a period of six months, repeatedly raped a girl at their school. The victim left a diary at home before committing suicide. The diary is discovered and in order to avert a full police investigation, the parents of the boys offer to pay a settlement to the family affected. Despite the troubles in her life and the pain she sees in the lives of others, she cannot help but focus on the positive things she sees instead. Yang visits the mother of the victim and strengthens her resolve to bring the young men, including her grandson, to justice. However, another way of reading Yang's change of heart is to attribute this change to the empathic link she develops with the girl's mother, rather than due to perceived wrongs which must be righted in order to satisfy some abstract notion of justice. Indeed, the appeal to the notion of justice in the previous paragraph's analysis seems to run counter to the overall message of the film. What "Poetry" is attempting to convey is not a formulaic solution to an unusual social happening, but rather a human response to a human tragedy.
