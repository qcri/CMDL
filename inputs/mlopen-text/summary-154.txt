Zandy Allan is a hard-working cattle rancher in a remote part of the American West who needs a hired hand more than he needs a wife. He sends away for a mail-order bride, a Swedish woman who lives near Minneapolis. Expecting a woman in her 20s, Zandy is surprised when Hannah Lund turns out to be 32. He is not interested in love, only in work, although this does not keep him from misbehaving around a local woman named Maria. Hannah is here, in his mind, strictly to help Zandy and his family run the ranch. Zandy is unaccustomed to the ways of the world and clearly a fish out of water during a visit to San Francisco. The more time he spends with Hannah, meanwhile, the less he comes to treat her as a mere possession that he has bought.
