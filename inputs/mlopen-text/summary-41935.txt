Dawn Glory wins. Bingo Nelson , a pilot famous for performing crazy stunts, immediately falls in love when he spots the photograph in his friend Click's suite. After heroically flying to Alaska through a blizzard to deliver serum for some sick children, he proposes to Dawn Glory on national radio. As a result, reporters clamor to interview the woman, putting Click in a tough spot. Slattery of the Express is particularly persistent, digging up Click's checkered past to try to blackmail him into giving him an exclusive interview.

Earlier in the day, Loretta had splurged and gotten her hair styled as in the photograph. Gladys and Ed pass off Loretta as Dawn. Soon, advertising endorsements and royalties make Click and Ed a lot of money. Simeon Hamburgher , president of Nemo Yeast, the beauty contest's sponsor, hires Bingo to fly over the city and tout Miss Glory's endorsement of his product over a loudspeaker. His bitter rival, J. Horace Freischutz , orders his assistant Joe Bonner to arrange a meeting somehow with Dawn, so he can try to persuade her to sign with him. Bonner pays thugs Petey and Blackie to kidnap her. After Petey learns that Dawn is really an impostor, he and his partner decide to blackmail Click instead.
