Speedy Gonzales owns the hottest nightclub in all of Mexico, Speedy's A-Go-Go Club, where mice dance to Spanish fiesta music. Upstairs, Daffy Duck cannot sleep because of the nightclub racket downstairs. He tries stuffing his ears with cotton and calling Speedy, attempting to crush him over the phone with a mallet. Daffy later attempts to "make the joint jump" with a grenade, which Speedy and his friends constantly pop back at him until it finally blows up and Daffy recites an odd poem . Finally, Daffy confronts Speedy personally and locks him out of the club but got the keys pulled from his neck by Speedy and his magnet. He then tries to shoot Speedy but instead hits the door and Speedy jumps in and pied Daffy. Finally, Daffy uses a vacuum cleaner to suck him in, but Speedy finds a can of gunpowder, sucks it into the vacuum and lights it, blowing the vacuum up. With Daffy out of the way, Speedy continues to play his music. Meanwhile, Daffy finally admits defeat and happily plays a pair of cymbals to the tune of Speedy's music as the cartoon ends.
