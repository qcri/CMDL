Enrico Puzzo is an eccentric Italian author who claims he knows the mafia from inside. Based on these allegations he wrote a book and sold it under a pen name to a German publishing house. Puzzo lives in an expensive hotel, where he doesn't hesitate to threaten employees with his pistol in case something isn't to his liking. He also consumes a great deal of cocaine, sometimes even at broad daylight on the balcony of his hotel suite. As crazy as he is, he writes on a typewriter and sends a unique typescript to his publisher who is already about to have a huge press conference on this book. That is when Toni Ricardelli , a German-born hitman of suave behaviour, comes into play. He intercepts the script just in time, leaving the publisher Christopher Kimbel empty-handed. Not the mafia, but the publisher is embarrassed. Editor Julia Steffens loses her job because of this fiasco. But she is encouraged by her fiancée, Christoper Kimbel's son Bob to try redeem herself. In order to do so she travels to Italy for she wants to persuade Enrico Puzzo to write it all again. Before she gets to him, Toni Ricardelli does. She nearly catches Toni in the act of killing Puzzo. Yet Toni is enchanted by her innocent charm and her cute clumsyness. Julia thinks he was Puzzo and he eventually indulges her because he is in love and just wants to be with her by all means. She takes Ricardelli to Germany, where he asks his blind uncle Pepe to make up some stories and to have them written down by a restaurant owner. But now mafia boss Salvatore Marino also believes Ricardelli was the unknown author and wants to have him killed. Trying to achieve that he hires a bunch of killers including Ricardelli's old rival Helmut Münchinger ("[[Jerry Cotton . Fortunately Münchinger is always distracted by phone calls of his beloved wife on his mobile phone. In the end Bob Kimbel marries his secretary Lisa and Toni Ricardelli lives to marry Julia Steffens.
