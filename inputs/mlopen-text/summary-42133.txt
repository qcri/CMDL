Sid plays a short, thirtyish DJ, who finds himself playing music at Trisha's marriage to Vivek in Delhi. However, he witnesses her fight her sense of responsibility and duty towards her parents and the groom, and runs away. Six months later, he meets her again at a DJ competition in Mumbai, which he has just lost, yet again. Before you know it, they're in a relationship, and three years have passed. Trisha thinks she is ready for marriage, and gets down on her knee to propose to Sid. Sid suffering from the typical commitment phobia, is at a loss for a reasonable answer. In a bid to not lose her, Sid finds himself engaged. But along with the engagement comes a new set of problems - such as shopping for furniture for their home, engagement rings, and more importantly facing the father of the bride! The father has more than one problem with Sid. He doesn't have a future, he earns a lot less than Trisha, and he doesn't seem responsible enough. Over an altercation Sid has with Trisha's father, the couple break up. Vivek, Trisha's ex-husband-to-be, is waiting in the wings, to help her broken heart mend. Sid on the other hand, finds himself being wooed by item girl, Tanya , star of the 'Baby Girl vol. 3' video. After a few amusing run-ins, an attempt to be just-friends, and a sad-song , Sid, finally realises, thanks to his mother, that his commitment phobia is the result of a childhood scar. His father abandoned Sid and his mother, when Sid was very young. His mother reassures him, that he is nothing like his father, and would make a great husband. But it's too late, Trisha has already agreed to marry Vivek. This leads him to Trisha's dear friend Anjali , who reminds him of Dracula because she always attacks him, for making Trisha unhappy. She helps him crash Trisha's wedding party. The climax builds up, as Sid's job involves not just convincing Trisha that his hang-ups have abated, but also avoid a deadly confrontation with Trisha's father.
