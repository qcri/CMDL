He meets up with the Country Bears, a Country music band that reached its peak years ago and eventually broke up (a parody of the [[Eagles . Beary helps the Country Bears reunite for one final concert while searching for who he truly is. Thanks to Beary, the band realizes they were wrong to break up, due to various petty arguments that escalated. Beary returns home to his family understanding that they truly do care about him. Country Bear Hall, the place at which the band used to perform, is threatened with destruction but the Country Bears decide to do a concert to save it. However, they refuse to do so without Beary who brought them back together after they read an essay he wrote about them. The band goes to get Beary and his family, but while Ted Bedderhead, the band leader and member who was the most reluctant to reunite, is apologizing to Beary and explaining everything to him, Reed Thimble kidnaps the rest of the Country Bears because he wants to destroy the Hall. Thanks to an idea from Dex, Beary, his older brother Ted, and their family are able to track down and rescue the band and head to the concert together. The promoter that was hired to publicize the concert is found to have been paid off by Thimble so the concert appears to be headed for failure. Big Al, the caretaker of the hall, reveals that everyone was just out back and when he opens the door surge of people rush in. The money raised from the concert is revealed to be enough to save the hall and the Country Bears perform with Beary as member of the band.
