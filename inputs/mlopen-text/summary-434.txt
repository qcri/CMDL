On his last assignment prior to resigning, burned out human rights activist James Rhodes arrives in Tijuana to help oversee local union elections. While there, he becomes embroiled in the investigation of a mass murder in what appears to be a drug runners' tunnel on the Tijuana/San Diego border. He teams up with a local street cop and a US official all under the watchful eye of State Department attache Spader, eager to pin the killings on a drug cartel. But when Rhodes links the human rights atrocity to the murder of two American teenage dirt bikers, he uncovers a web of corruption between a US corporation and the local police, only to realize that he himself has become a dangerous liability to those who pull the puppet strings on one of the world's most dangerous borders.
