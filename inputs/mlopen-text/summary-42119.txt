The film intertwines several unsettling stories of people in a Manhattan neighborhood ravaged by crack cocaine.Six Immigrating to "Cracktown": www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00007693.html Romeo, a 14-year-old criminal, leads his gang into robbing and torturing a very sick pensioner, and then steps up to doing a murder-for-hire at the behest of a local drug dealer, unaware of the enormous risks. Manny and Concetta, a young couple, are desperately trying to rise out of poverty and care for their sick baby. Manny works two jobs - the front desk of a drug-riddled flop house by day and the cash register of a frequently-robbed bodega at night. It hardly matters that he is working so hard because the baby's non-stop crying will not allow him to sleep. Another young couple, Marybeth and Benny, are both drug addicts, and Marybeth is actually a pre-op transexual named Mickey. Marybeth makes a bit of money as a street prostitute, and Benny is into very low-paying burglaries. Their principal source of drugs is a well-off transexual named Ridley, who is looking to follow in Marybeth's footsteps. Young Willy and younger Susie are the much-neglected children of an addict named Mommy, who makes them sleep on the floor of their one room apartment. Mommy's current boyfriend, a hot-tempered addict named Chaz, makes the children beg on the street for his drug money. Willy's one bright spot is neighbor child Melody, whose mother pimps her out every night. When Chaz and Mommy leave the children behind while they embark on a drug-fueled quest to get more drug money from a relative of Chaz, and Melody is picked up by the police. Willy, meanwhile, is sent on a wild goose chase by Betty, an aging prostitute who enjoys tormenting her neighbors. The movie dramatizes about half the stories in the 1993 book of the same name.
