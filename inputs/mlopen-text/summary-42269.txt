An organized crime war breaks out between two rival gangs in Chicago during the Roaring Twenties. The leader of the mob is the notorious Al Capone, who resents his nemesis Bugs Moran's activity in the city. Moran, too, wants to control the whole town. Capone and his thugs Peter and Frank Gusenberg use threats and intimidation to make tavern owners do business with them in exchange for "protection." Moran gives the order to have a crony of Capone's eliminated as the Chicago body count escalates. Inclusive in the escalating war are a lunchtime attack on Capone at a restaurant outside of Chicago by Hymie Weiss and Moran and the murders of Weiss and Dion O'Banion by Capone In a bid to get rid of Moran once and for all, Capone goes to Florida to establish an alibi while his henchmen, some dressed as cops, ambush and execute seven members of Moran's gang in a garage on February 14, 1929.
