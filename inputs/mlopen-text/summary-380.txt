Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty , being laid off. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Voss attempts to raise the $48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive. At first, he works as a night instructor for a citizenship class.

When he arrives at Niko's apartment, he realizes that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter. While watching UFC at Niko's apartment, Voss learns that the loser of the fight receives $10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting in MMA himself. Later in the film, Voss gets signed to the UFC finds out that he has to win his fight on the undercard because a colleague embezzled money from Voss's Fights. The event turns out to be UFC 176: Carwin vs. Dos Santos and he manages to win his UFC fight and gets $50,000 for his victory and saves the music program at his school.
