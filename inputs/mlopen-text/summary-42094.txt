Young couples experiment with anonymous group sex as a way to revitalize their troubled relationships. Through the experience they are forced to rethink the rudiments of a successful relationship: sex, love, and communication. One couple, James and Heather, have lost the spark in their relationship; a cold distance has grown between them and their intimate moments feel forced. Heather is a take-charge problem solver who sometimes gets too carried away for her own good. James, meanwhile, has recently discovered that he's easily manipulated. Another couple, Ellis and Renee, fear that they are at the beginning of the end of their relationship. Renee is thoughtful and honest, but recently she's found herself feeling slightly isolated and bored with Ellis, who puts on a brash, macho front to disguise his insecurity. Both couples seek therapy with Dr. Wellbridge, who offers them experimental treatment to rekindle the cooling relationship. On the doctor's orders, the couples embark on a partner swap that leaves some thrilled and others thwarted, but the truth about their relationships is revealed to all four.
