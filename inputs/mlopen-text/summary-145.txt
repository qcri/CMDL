Contemporary New Orleans jazz musicians discuss their childhood introductions to music in Baptist churches and through local traditions like second line and Jazz Funerals, and the role of Danny Barker in keeping traditional New Orleans Jazz alive through the 70’s and 80’s. Asking the artists point blank, director Darren Hoffman explores the potential “death” of traditional jazz through modernization and marginalization and its preservation through mentorship and the continuation of traditions that intrigue and inspire young people to play the music of previous generations.
