The film is very loyal to its source material, depicting the labored and painstakingly slow efforts of main character—Jewish Harry Lesser—in drafting what is to be his third novel. Lesser is the remaining tenant of a dilapidated tenement. The landlord—for reasons not revealed—cannot or does not evict Lesser, though he periodically offers increasing amounts of money to entice Lesser to move. At some point Lesser becomes aware that another tenant—an Afro-American squatter named Willie Spearmint—has taken up residence in the tenement, and that this other tenant is also a writer who has determined to type his book at the tenement as well. The two eventually become acquainted and become embroiled in a deadly conflict over Spearmint's Jewish girlfriend, Irene.
