The film starts with Negaal, a former kickboxer who founded an organization that promotes other kickboxers who pay with their lives if they refuse to join, ordering his men to kill David Sloan for refusing to accept an invitation from them. Days later Johnny Styles wins the American kickboxing championship and is approached by Negaal’s men for an invitation, but Matt Reeves, Johnny’s friend and teacher, becomes suspicious about it. That night Johnny is murdered by Negaal's men, but not without Reeves arriving and beating them. Now wanting revenge, Matt Reeves travels to South Africa to chase after Negaal himself and joins a fighter, Paul Croft, who Negaal ordered to kill Reeves but disobeyed. In South Africa they encounter and fight Negaal’s men in a cat and mouse game throughout the film, going to prison in a trap set up by one of Negaal’s henchmen and escaping it heading to Croft’s home. Meanwhile Negaal recruits more fighters into his organization, with himself fighting and killing the German champion when he refused to join, and killing one of his own men for failing to get Reeves. Reeves, Croft, and Croft's sister arrive in Negaal’s mansion during the organization’s inauguration party, and they expose to the public Negaal’s true intentions and crimes. Matt Reeves fights his way to Negaal himself who is waiting at his office and the two men fight a duel to the death, with Reeves defeating and killing him.
