Count Vertigo hires Merlyn to assassinate Princess Perdita, Vertigo's niece. Princess Perdita is now the queen of Vlatava due to the king, Perdita's Father, being assassinated by Vertigo. While Princess Perdita is at an airport in America, Merlyn attacks her. Green Arrow is also at the airport waiting on the arrival of an apparent fellow Justice League member. Green Arrow discovers the Vertigo's plan and is forced to intervene. Green Arrow dispatches several henchmen of Merlyn while keeping Princess Perdita safe before having to duel Merlyn himself. After Merlyn is defeated, Vertigo steps in and attempts to kill both the hero and Perdita, only to be defeated when Black Canary arrives and knocks him unconscious with her "Canary Cry". After the battle with Vertigo, Green Arrow proposes marriage to Black Canary with Princess Perdita's eager support. Black Canary accepts Green Arrow's proposal.
