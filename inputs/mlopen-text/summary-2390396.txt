Larry Bishop stars as biker Pistolero, (named after the original title for Robert Rodriguez’s [[Desperado  the leader, or "Pres" of the Victors, a Southern California motorcycle gang. He has two faithful lieutenants, The Gent  and Comanche . In 1976, Cherokee Kisum , the girlfriend of Pistolero  is viciously murdered by The Deuce  and Billy Wings , leaders of the archrival gang the Six-Six-Six'ers, as a message to the Victors. The Deuce later moves into large scale business efforts, leaving the biker life behind and the Sixers dry up as a gang. Cherokee Kisum has also hidden away a small fortune from under-the-table drug deals she made behind the Deuce's back - the reason for which she is murdered. The stash of money is intended for her young son, who disappears after her death. Years later, after The Deuce returns to the area to close up unfinished business and Billy Wings reforms the Sixers in Los Angeles, the rival gang infiltrates the Victors in an attempt to take over their territory. One member from 1976, St. Louie, is murdered in the same manner as Cherokee Kisum. Bob the Bum, the Victors' treasurer, is similarly killed. Pistolero then begins to make moves to eliminate the Sixers and finally gain his revenge. While loyal bikers are killed by the Sixers, the more treacherous and less faithful Victors try to influence The Gent, Comanche, and Goody Two-Shoes to switch sides - or kill them. Goody Two-Shoes, the Victors' only black member, is eventually killed after being located and chased down by Billy Wings. With the aid of his beautiful "medicine woman" Nada  and his old friend and ally Eddie Zero , Pistolero and the remaining Victors try to locate and kill The Deuce, Billy Wings and the Sixers before they themselves are killed.
