In 1955, young waitress Lenora finds herself inexplicably driving down the California highway to an unknown destination. This doesn't bode well for Cam , the hitchhiker she picked up, because he has to endure her somnambulist driving. The duo eventually end up at a graveside in the woods and meet alchemist Aaron , who is just as shocked to see them as Lenora appears to be the reincarnation of his wife who was murdered nearly 100 years earlier.
