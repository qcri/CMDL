The evening of July 4, in Las Vegas, Hank and Frannie break up while celebrating their fifth anniversary, due to Hank's insensitivity to Frannie's yearning for adventure and excitement. They both spend a night with their idealized partner—Leila, a nubile and beautiful circus girl , for Hank, and Ray, a dark, handsome musician , for Frannie. After their nights of passion, Hank breaks down and tracks Frannie to her lover's apartment and abducts her. On returning home she refuses to go in and walks away, saying that this time it is definitely goodbye forever. Hank follows her to the airport where she is about to leave for her dream trip to Bora Bora with Ray. Hank sings to her to prove he is willing to be more romantic, but she boards the plane, saying it is too late. Hank, distraught, goes home and is about to burn her clothes when Frannie returns, realising she "made a mistake".
