ACTIVATOR,"Positively effects the normal functioning of the protein e.g., activation of an enzyme or cleaving a clotting protein precursor",POSITIVE MODULATOR
AGONIST,"Binds to and activates a receptor, often mimicking the effect of the endogenous ligand",POSITIVE MODULATOR
ALLOSTERIC ANTAGONIST,Binds to a receptor at an allosteric site and prevents activation by a positive allosteric modulator at that site,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
ANTAGONIST,Binds to a receptor and prevents activation by an agonist through competing for the binding site,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
ANTISENSE INHIBITOR,Prevents translation of a complementary mRNA sequence through binding and targeting it for degradation,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
BINDING AGENT,"Binds to a substance such as a cell surface antigen, targetting a drug to that location, but not necessarily affecting the functioning of the substance itself",OTHER
BLOCKER,"Negatively effects the normal functioning of an ion channel e.g., prevents or reduces transport of ions through the channel",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
CHELATING AGENT,"Binds to a metal, reducing its availability for further interactions",OTHER
CROSS-LINKING AGENT,Induces cross-linking of proteins or nucleic acids,OTHER
DEGRADER,"Binds to or antagonizes a receptor, leading to its degradation",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
DISRUPTING AGENT,"Destabilises or disrupts a protein complex, macromolecular assembly, cell membrane etc",OTHER
HYDROLYTIC ENZYME,Hydrolyses a substrate through enzymatic reaction,OTHER
INHIBITOR,"Negatively effects (inhibits) the normal functioning of the protein e.g., prevention of enzymatic reaction or activation of downstream pathway",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
INVERSE AGONIST,Binds to and inactivates a receptor,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
METHYLATING AGENT,"Methylates or participates in methylation (e.g., through donation of a methyl group) of a substrate molecule",OTHER
MODULATOR,"Effects the normal functioning of a protein in some way e.g., mixed agonist/antagonist or unclear whether action is positive or negative",OTHER
NEGATIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR,Reduces or prevents the action of the endogenous ligand of a receptor through binding to a site distinct from that ligand (non-competitive inhibition),NEGATIVE MODULATOR
NEGATIVE MODULATOR,"Negatively effects the normal functioning of a protein e.g., receptor antagonist, inverse agonist or negative allosteric modulator",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
OPENER,"Positively effects the normal functioning of an ion channel e.g., facilitates transport of ions through the channel",POSITIVE MODULATOR
OTHER,"Other action type, not clearly postively or negatively affecting the normal functioning of a protein e.g., chelation of substances, hydrolysis of substrate",OTHER
OXIDATIVE ENZYME,Oxidises a substrate through enzymatic reaction,OTHER
PARTIAL AGONIST,Binds to and only partially activates a receptor (relative to the response to a full agonist),POSITIVE MODULATOR
POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR,Enhances the action of the endogenous ligand of a receptor through binding to a site distinct from that ligand,POSITIVE MODULATOR
POSITIVE MODULATOR,"Positively effects the normal functioning of a protein e.g., receptor agonist, positive allosteric modulator, ion channel activator",POSITIVE MODULATOR
PROTEOLYTIC ENZYME,Hydrolyses a protein substrate through enzymatic reaction,OTHER
REDUCING AGENT,Modifies a substrate via a reduction reaction,OTHER
RELEASING AGENT,"Reverses the normal functioning of a transporter, causing release of the substrate, rather than uptake",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
RNAI INHIBITOR,"Prevents translation of mRNA through binding and targeting it for destruction (e.g., siRNA)",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
SEQUESTERING AGENT,"Binds to a substance such as a drug, toxin or metabolite reducing its availability for further interactions",OTHER
STABILISER,Increases the conformational stability of a protein or complex,OTHER
SUBSTRATE,"Carried by a transporter, possibly competing with the natural substrate for transport",OTHER
