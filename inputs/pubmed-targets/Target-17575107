Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) remains one of the most lethal human cancers. We hypothesized that sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of the BRaf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta kinase, would decrease tumor growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic model of ATC. The in vitro antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of sorafenib on ATC cell lines were examined. To study the in vivo effects of sorafenib on orthotopic ATC tumors in nude mice, sorafenib was given p.o. at 40 or 80 mg/kg daily. Intratumoral effects were studied using immunohistochemical analysis. The effect of sorafenib on survival of the mice was also studied. Sorafenib inhibited the in vitro proliferation of ATC cell lines. Sorafenib also significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis via the induction of endothelial apoptosis in an orthotopic model of thyroid cancer. As result, the growth of orthotopic ATC xenografts was reduced and the survival of the test animals was improved. Sorafenib exerts significant antitumor activity in an orthotopic xenograft model of ATC via a potent antiangiogenic effect. The antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib suggest that its use in clinical setting may not depend on the BRAF mutational status of thyroid tumors. Given the lack of curative options for patients with ATC, sorafenib warrants further study as a therapeutic agent against ATC.
